This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.
First change:I was able to implement the background and how it is changing colors. I also added a flower at the top of my canvas as a I saw big candy from the inspiration.

Second change: I aligned everything up in the center and was able to make th UI look cleaner.
